## Description
A professional first person camera controller made in Godot 4 with a very specific set of goals:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

* It must be as **responsive as it can**.
* It must use **raw input**.
* Sensitivity must be **stretch and scale independent**.
* Sensitivity must be **frame rate independent**.
* the nodeâ€™s **transforms must not deteriorate** over time.
